Written in python. How this works is the code uses pyautogui.

You will have to point where chrome exists on your particular system path.

Manually do a search to get the link address of the first picture you want to find. 

Put that slug text in.

Set up the folder path and naming scheme.

You will likely have to set the coordinates to your particular screen of where the 'next image' '>' button is to the upper right of the current image selected.

If anything goes haywire - put your mouse to the bottom right of the screen.

Have fun. I've downloaded thousands of images this way.
